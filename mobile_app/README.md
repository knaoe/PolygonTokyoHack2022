## About Project(2-3 lines)

MOVER is a global HR mobile app that allows the community to
easily search for moderators' experience and capabilities, and hire/contract/pay them in just 3 clicks.

## the problem it is solving

DAOs and communities have anonymous community moderators with knowledge of cutting-edge areas such
as Web3 and the Metaverse. It is very time consuming to agree, contract, and settle across borders.

As of June 13, 2022, there are more than 10,000 DAOs. If they are serious about taking care of their
community participants, they must hire at least one native English speaker, and in the case of global 
services, multiple language speakers such as Chinese. In addition, in order to hire them, they must 
properly assess the abilities and track record of moderators who speak different languages 
than they do, which requires time and effort. Despite this need, there are currently no tools to
standardize/visualize their abilities and compensation, and to contract/pay them based on 
mutually agreed-upon compensation.
